Create a web page with JavaScript logic that reverses the order of a string.

Examples: if I input AI4Devs, it should return sveD4IA. If I input Fever is awesome, it should return emosewa si reveF

All the UI must be placed in a file called index.html and all the JavaScript logic should be contained in a file called script.js
